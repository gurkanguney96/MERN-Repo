TERRAFORM STEPS

- Terraform Server Connection to GCP

gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project [your-project-id]


- Service Account Create

gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform-sa \
    --description="Terraform için hizmet hesabı" \
    --display-name="Terraform Service Account"

- Service Account Role

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project-name \
    --member="serviceAccount:terraform-sa@<my-project-name>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/owner"


- Service Account Key File

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/terraform-key.json \
    --iam-account=terraform-sa@<my-project-name>.gserviceaccount.com

- Add VPC Subnets

gcloud compute networks subnets update default \
  --region=europe-west1 \
  --add-secondary-ranges=pods-range=10.20.0.0/16,services-range=10.30.0.0/20


DEPLOYMENT STEPS

I prepared Dockerfiles, deployment.yaml, azure-pipeline.yaml files(for CI/CD).


MONGODB STEPS

I added deployment yaml file for mongodb installation.


MONITORING STEPS

I used helm chart and installed Grafana and Loki for logging system so I saw logs of pods. 
I added Grafana image to file.



SUMMARY

I deployed all components. I have experience Kubernetes, cloud platforms, CI/CD processes and monitoring processes but I do not have react and nodejs coding. You can see output images in file. The web app does not work complately because I do not have enough time. Also I work at the same time.
I am man of duty and I love learning. I hope we can meet again. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day.
